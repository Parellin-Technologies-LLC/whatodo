A TODO collector, organizer, and task manager

Do you write `TODO` comments all over your code?

I certainly do.

Wouldn't it be nice to pull those TODOs out and have priorities, links to where to your code, all ready to go?

List priorities:

- `// TODO: low priority`
- `// TODO:: mid priority`
- `// TODO::: high priority`

Output:

```
